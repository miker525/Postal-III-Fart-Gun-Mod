Postal III Fart Gun Weapon Mod
==================

Postal III or Postal 3 is the third official game in the Postal video game franchise originally developed by Akella and takes place in the aftermath of Postal 2 by Postal owner and developer on the first two Postal titles Running With Scissors. Of course Postal III was a pretty horrific attempt at a game and without any support from Akella to either modders or Running With Scissors improving the mess the game was became near impossible. At the time the game launched I decided to attempt to restore some of the content that had been cut. Of course this was the only project I had finished but it does work. In the Russian version of Postal III there were some changes to the weapons including an extra Russian only weapon called the Fart Gun. Yep. It's exactly what it sounds like. After a bit of scouring the web I found some of the missing files and eventually was able to put enough together to get it working in the US version of Postal III. Follow the directions below for installation help.

Installation Instructions:
- Download the zip file provided from this git repository
- Merge the p3 and p3_english folders with those that exist in Steam\Steamapps\Common\PostalIII . Don't worry. No files will be replaced, only added.
- Copy the entire contents of the Fart_Gun_Sound_Script.txt into the game_sounds_weapons_p3.txt file located in Steam\Steamapps\common\postaliii\p3\scripts\sound. Don't edit or remove anything else in the file. Just paste our script at the bottom of the other file and save.
- Congratulations! You're Done! It is installed.

Help!
- This is a mod for a horribly built game. The game has occasionally been reported to crash at certain points in the game with the mod installed. Unfortunately since the game is so buggy and problematic even without mods it's impossible to know whether this is mod related. This mod should NOT effect gameplay in anyway and should not crash the game but I've heard using the gun during certain missions will cause crashes. Feel free to reach out if you've got any issues or even solutions. 
- Certain missions will spawn you with the modded gun. If you're having issues getting the gun into your inventory use the console commands posted below. In order to use the console ensure developer mode is on in the options menu and then press the tilde (~) key.
- Use console commands: "sv_cheats 1" followed by "give p3_weapon_gamamet". The gun will be in your weapon inventory and will be functional!
